sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: When sorting an already sorted array, the number of passes is the same as the length of the
array, speeding up the process, and this can be seen as sort3 (Selection Sort) takes a lot more time to quit.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The speed of sort2 is hugely noticeable on big datasets since the running time does not
increase much when more steps to sort are needed.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: On reversed arrays, as small numbers are moved to the beginning, large numbers line themselves
on the end of the array and the middle number stays in place, so only half of the array is actively sorted.
