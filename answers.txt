If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would first categorize the most repeated genres of music, this gives you a, probably, good idea of what the user likes the most.
You could also check the most listened artists and build on from there.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Not necessarily the most listend artists, songs or genres reflect the true musical aura of the listener, since the same device may be used by many
people or just rarely access the app to search a random song. I believe inspecting user-created playlists could be a way to get an idea of the user's musical tastes.
